\section{Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)}
\label{sec:mlp}

The third model I try is Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
I directly use the MLP model provided by \textit{sklearn} library.
The activation function is ReLU, and the optimizer is Adam.
We scan different hidden neuron number in the experiment Section \ref{sec:model-selection}.
